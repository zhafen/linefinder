Installation
==========

Installation of linefinder is straightforward using pip.
Because you may alter some parts of linefinder, e.g. the config file, it's recommended you specify the install directory, e.g. ::

   pip install linefinder --target=/where/you/want

This is also useful for clusters, which don't usually allow root access (an alternative is the ``--user`` flag).
